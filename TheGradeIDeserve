The grade I deserve is a 7.

I did worked through the basics allright, but nothing special or advanced. I successfully created files, cloned repositories,
followed people, filed an issue and a pull request. I also managed to push and pull files from the command line. Sorry for the
lack of screenshots, Linux via VirtualBox on this laptop has been a nightmare today! :/
